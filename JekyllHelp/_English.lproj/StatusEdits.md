When someone has edited a post, you see a button **View History**. This will show the **status edits sidebar**.

This allows you to see what has changed. For example, perhaps a typo has been fixed, or perhaps the meaning of a sentence has been clarified — or altered.

You can optionally toggle a checkbox **Highlight Differences** to colorize changes in the text.
