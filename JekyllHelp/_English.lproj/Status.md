The **status sidebar** shows when you click on a status.

For the selected status, it shows the post larger and with more details:

- if it was very long, this shows the entire contents of the text
- it shows how many people have interacted with it: replied to it, boosted it, or favorited it

Moreover, it shows the status within the context of a thread. If it was in reply to another status, that status gets shown above. (And if that status, too, was in reply to something, you may see an entire chain of statuses above.) Likewise, if others are replying to this status, you will see them below.
