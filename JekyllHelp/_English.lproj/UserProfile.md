The **user profile sidebar** shows when you click on a user name.

Depending on what they have filled out, it shows a larger view of their profile picture, their header picture, their bio, some brief statistics (total toots, follows, and followers), and their metadata, such as a link to their blog.

Below that, it also shows their toots (without replies), their toots _with_ replies, and specifically just their media toots.

At the top, you get buttons to follow, block, or mute this person.
